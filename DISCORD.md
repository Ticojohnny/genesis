### Here is a what our welcome message and rules of participation looks like:

### **Welcome to the unofficial AtomOne Discord Channel!**
This Discord server is dedicated to fostering collaboration, discussion, and innovation for AtomOne, an alternative fork of Gaia ("cosmoshub4"). AtomOne upholds Cosmos' core components of security, sustainability, and decentralization and offers a minimal and secure alternative IBC hub to prepare for all contingencies. 

**Why Do We Need AtomOne?**
The Cosmos community is at a crossroads and constantly confronts divergent views on key aspects such as mission, tokenomics, and security philosophy. AtomOne provides an alternative, more security-conscious branch, complementing the broader Cosmos ecosystem. 

**Server guidelines & code of conduct**
To ensure a productive and respectful environment for all contributors, we adhere to the following guidelines:

**Respect and inclusivity** 
Treat all members with respect. We welcome diverse viewpoints and encourage constructive discussions. Respect the privacy and boundaries of all community members.

**No harassment** 
Harassment in any form is not tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, bullying and use of derogatory language.

**Stay on topic** 
Please keep discussions relevant to the channel topics. This helps in maintaining clarity and efficiency in our conversations.

**No spamming** 
Avoid spamming messages, links, or images. Share content that contributes to the discussions.

### Here is what our moderation policies look like:


### **Expectations Of A Moderator:** 

**Do your best to help community members with answers about AtomOne related questions:**

- If members are looking for documentation please point them to the repo.

- If you think you know exactly which issue the conversation is about, try to make that available. 

- If they're looking for specific info or reporting disruptions about any other project, please direct them to the official channel of that project

**Be in the channel consistently within reason to ensure that scams are not popping up, make sure to delete them as soon as you can.**

- A big part of the role of a moderator is to ensure that community members stay safe, it is always good to have an eye on the channel in case someone joins to spread spams, scams or misinformation.

**Ensure that you are not sharing rumors, and make an effort to guide conversations back to constructive, productive and building-focused chats**

- Conversations should be relevant to AtomOne, or GovGen

- If conversation steers away from AtomOne or GovGen in a way that is not bringing relevant or benefit to the conversation, try to invite the community members in the conversation to come back to the main topic or to continue the conversation in an off-topic channel.

**Try to ensure that people show respect each other, even while sharing differing opinions:**

- People should feel comfortable sharing thoughts and opinions. Abusive, oppressive or bullying attitude should not be welcome in the channels, please try to de-escalate before turning to more administrative means (i.e, mutes, removals)

**Avoid engaging with people who are there to create chaos and present disrespectful, condescending or inappropriate attitudes, try to stay detached and provide warnings:**

- See more in the [Disciplinary Measures] sections
- If it becomes evident that individuals are purposefully promoting their token or product without engaging in a constructive discussion related to AtomOne, please take appropriate action by muting them

**Encourage users to protect their privacy:** 

- Alert people that giving details about their location, email addresses and so on could be not the best decision. Delete the message if they do so.

**Encourage Developers and Validators to join our Discord Server and to use appropriate channels**

- The general channels under Lounge should stay entry-level, try to direct any technical questions, or validator inquiries to the #support and #validator channels respectively so that conversations can stay relevant to their categories.

**Encourage users to do their own research.**

- A lot of the time people will come in hoping to find an absolute answer, but most of the time that isn't possible, especially with questions regarding their own finances.** 

- Try to avoid giving absolute answers unless you are absolutely certain that is true.

- Always refer members to existing articles or groups that will more likely have the information that is relevant to what they are looking for

**Avoid Direct Messaging (DM) anyone, even if they reach out first:** 

- Please attempt to resolve all the eventual issues/disruptions within the chat room, unless the information exchanged is confidential in which case the moderator should ask the user to initiate the direct message.

**Avoid sending tokens to community members**

- This will set a precedence that is not fun to continue, encourage the use of faucets

**Share the latest announcement and the most important news from AtomOne's Github, or other future social platforms to encourage healthy discussions.**

### **Disciplinary Measures**

Cases can usually be divided into 3 categories:

Scams/Spam: Those who post scams or intentionally spam the channel with promotional content regarding projects not belonging to the AtomOne ecosystem.

Inappropriate Behavior: Those who use vulgar language or behave aggressively or inappropriately towards other users.

Toxic Behavior: Those who make heavy personal attacks, racism, sexism or discriminatory, defamatory or any other toxic behavior

**Scams/Spam**

- Scams and spam can come in many different forms:
 
- Content that is extremely irrelevant to AtomOne
 
- Talking about shitcoins, memecoins, weird Ethereum or BSC contracts
 
- Users offering financial advice, "Fred made me $5,000 dollars,"

- "User support" that links to wallets that aren't what is used for AtomOne

We should have a bot instantiated at some point to remove the scam/spam immediately, however if the bot happens to miss it, please delete the message and ban the user who posted it.

**Inappropriate Behavior**

Inappropriate behavior can be identified as:

- Person who ignores help and claims to have answers we cannot provide or claims to have them in an inappropriate way.

- People who insist on carrying on attitudes that are vulgar, intimidating, disrespectful or that may in any way make the rest of the community uncomfortable.

- People who do not observe the topic of the chat by intentionally going on tangential and borderline abusive conspiracy related conversation.

In these cases, the suggested behavior is as follows:

Warn the person that he/she will continue to persist in their behavior, they will be removed from the community. Once you warn someone, please mention it in the moderator's only channel.

After two warnings, no matter the time passed from the first and the second one, this person will be muted for 1 day. Then you can inform the person in the channel, inviting him/her to DM you to find a way to resolve this in the best way possible.

If the person proves to be uncooperative, uses other accounts to continue with his conduct despite the imposed limitation or after the period of limitation starts again with the unsuitable behavior, it will be necessary to mute the person again.

Please report this situation in the AtomOne Moderator's Only channel with the screenshot of the message that triggered the second mute and we can have a vote on permanent bans.

**Toxic Behavior**

These cases can be identified as:

- People who carry out personal attacks on other members of the channel
 
- People who use toxic language with references to racism, sexism and any sort of discrimination.

In these cases, please:

Mute the person immediately and report it to the AtomOne Moderator's only channel and we can have a vote on permanent bans.
