Brief Summary of Discussion

- The proposed AtomOne project has made significant progress with Phase -1 now complete, and the first code-freeze approaching in a few weeks.
- Key milestones include the publication of the AtomOne Roadmap, Tokenomics, ATONE Distribution, Software Versioning and the AtomOne Constitution (September 9th) on the GovGen Forum for community feedback.
- Feedback will be collected until September 13th for the first four proposals, and until September 16th for the Constitution. On-chain voting for these proposals should begin on September 13th and September 16th, respectively, with a proposed 10-day voting period.
- The GovGen dApp will launch on September 13th to streamline governance interactions, and the initial code-freeze for AtomOne is set for September 26th. The community is encouraged to participate by providing feedback, voting on proposals, and preparing for validator roles as AtomOne approaches its launch. You can find all of the proposals linked above in the *Main action items* section
- Please reference the [document shared during the meeting for further details on this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cxkJic7_i0XODNcF5_gFlu0KaxcIDmsckpHfjRK75DQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- After moving on from the text document giving a signicant update on the timeline, the session turned into more of a discussion format with people asking questions and giving suggestion.
- The meeting moved onto discussions about validator elections, governance, and technical updates.
- There was consensus around separating validation from governance, noting that validator sets often become bureaucracies. Worth noting that the Constitution provided a solution for alot of the concerns in validator power, so worth checking out the the Validator section in the AtomOne Constitution.
- Participants also addressed the challenges of decentralized governance, like coordination costs and dissemination of proposal information.
- There was a suggestion on implementing multiple-choice voting for proposals, but there were a few objections on the decision making that led to that possiblity on the CosmosSDK
- The meeting started wrapping up and touched on communication platforms, with opinions on using Commonwealth over forums.
- It concluded with a mention of the upcoming AtomOne logo and inviting people to participate in creating their own version which could potentially be submitted on the AtomOne chain.
- Note that you can check your potential allocation assuming all the existing distribution proposal moves forward [here](https://govgen.io/#trackers)
