  -   Participants must create unique logos that reflect their creativity and innovation. They must submit full-size and short logos, each in three colors (including white and black). Participants can submit up to two entries.
  -   The total prize pool is $28,000, with four grand prizes of $7,000 each. Winners must waive their rights to the intellectual property of their designs in favor of All In Bits, allowing them to use the logos for the AtomOne project.

- #### Working Group Form Update
  - Closed on April 20th
  - 29 respondents
  - **Time Slot**
    - The most mentioned time slots (in PDT) were: 9am, 8am, 7am, 6am, 10am, 6pm
    - The 6am slot is crucial for folks in China and South Korea
    - Of those that mentioned dates, Tuesday and Wednesdays were predominant
    - Given that information I would suggest we continue with the Tuesday slot, alternating between 6am, 9am, 6pm time slots. Maybe an experimental 2am timeslot lead by someone in Europe.
  - **Blockers from participating**
    - Many people requested the meeting time a week or two in advance to ensure they have the time slot available, I think we can improve on this.
    - People mentioned time constraints as the main blocker
  - **What would make a good constitution?**
    - **Transparency and Decentralization**: Preventing abuse of power and ensuring fairness for all contributors.
    - **Flexibility and Clarity**: Balancing flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances with clarity on core principles, avoiding overly bureaucratic language, and maintaining a clear direction for the project.
    - **Community Engagement and Support**: Supporting community initiatives, funding projects aligned with core values, and fostering inclusivity within the AtomOne ecosystem.
    - **Ethical Framework and Dispute Resolution**: Incorporating an ethical framework to guide behavior and establishing clear procedures for resolving disputes, promoting respect, equity, and fairness.
    - **Minimalism and Accessibility**: Advocating for a minimalist approach to the constitution, using simple language for accessibility, and ensuring broad understanding and participation within the community.
  - **What specific topics would you like to contribute to?**
    - **Governance and Decentralization**: Several folks expressed a desire to contribute to aspects related to governance, decentralization, and the role of validators within the ecosystem.
    - **Economics and Economic Incentives**: Many indicated interest in contributing ideas for economic incentives to increase voting participation and discussions on voting mechanisms.
    - **Community Development and Innovation** **Support**: There was significant interest in contributing to crafting guidelines and support systems for innovation within the AtomOne ecosystem, including mentorship programs and collaborations with external partners.
    - **Philosophical and Fundamental Principles**: Some respondents expressed a desire to contribute to defining clear fundamental principles that would guide the constitution and the project as a whole.
    - **Proofreading and Legal Advisory**: A notable number of people expressed interest in proofreading the entire constitution, providing input on specific topics, and offering legal advice regarding the content, structure, and design of the AtomOne Constitution.
