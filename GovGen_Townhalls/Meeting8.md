- All tools, scripts and code stuff for GovGen proposals (e.g. snapshots analysis code, prop 001 code) now available at https://github.com/atomone-hub/govbox
  
- The majority of the rest of this call was a discussion on the distribution draft proposal and whether non stakers and non voters should be slash or penalized.
- Some community members made the point that those that don’t stake or vote should get less distribution than even those who voted yes because at the least they participating in the governance system to begin with and many seemed to be in agreement. 
- Further discussion on whether individual voters should be treated differently than those who inherited a vote via delegation.
- Commentary on defining “ICS 1.5” which can be further elaborated upon in this issue "Defining ICS 1.5": https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/66#issuecomment-2006912939
