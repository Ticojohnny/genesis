**Brief Summary of Discussion**

<br>

- Distribution of this first proposal has changed, check the notes here:

<br>

 - Engineering updates on latest state of distribution prop draft: https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-proposals/pull/5
    - We took into account the community feedback regarding the previous
      distribution, especially the fact that non-voters (including abstrainers)
      had too much of the supply (61%). As a result we replaced the blend
      formula with an other formula that ensures the non-voters don't get more
      than 33% of the supply.
    - In addition, we decided to apply a 0.1 decimation factor to the entire
      supply.

- Distribution proposal companion doc (and code): https://github.com/atomone-hub/govbox/blob/master/PROP-001.md
    - Added details on the new formula mentioned above
- Long discussion ensues regarding the validity of the new distribution, including some comments on abstain votes, no/nwv distribution to be upped a bit and concession on the not staked and not voted voters.
- Thereâ€™s a note brought up that this is the first proposal for distribution and changes can happen over the lifespan of GovGen, every proposal is intended to measure sentiment so 
- Vladimir of Post Human shares a demonstration of their work on a [governance interface](https://proposals.posthuman.digital/) allowing you to create text proposals with some comments on including different types of proposal in the future.
- Alex gives a presentation of the feature set of the [GovGen](https://govgen.io/) governance dApp, including sorting proposals, GitHub discussions integration to allow convenience in following discussions per proposal and touching on some intended features
