**Statement**

We are pleased to announce that the AtomOne draft distribution proposal is now finalized and available for community review. You can access it [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-proposals/blob/main/001_ATONE_DISTRIBUTION.md)

In accordance with best practices, we are currently focused on completing rigorous code audit processes for both the GovGen dApp and the GovGen chain binaries. To this end, we are working to ensure that all necessary measures are in place for a secure code release process.

Based on our current progress, we anticipate this process to be concluded within the next three weeks.
Once this is completed, we plan to proceed with the deployment of the GovGen dApp followed shortly after by the release of the AtomOne draft distribution proposal on chain.

Your ongoing contribution and commitment are greatly appreciated as we navigate through these final stages.

**Brief Summary of Discussion**

This call was relatively short with a pending need to audit the AtomOne draft distribution. The Proposal is to go live after auditing for the signing process has happened 

There was some discussion on a need for a disclaimer on the binary within the repo which some engineers offered to implement.

The majority of the call is focused on the signing process and the auditing process that needs to be finished before the proposal can be put on chain.

Further discusson on repeatable deterministic builds and being able to build it using Go 1.21

Last minute suggestion to split the constitution calls into seperate working groups.

**Other suggested talking points**

<br>

- Further conversation on Defining "ICS 1.5": https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/66#issuecomment-2006912939
- Further conversation on what the relationship between Photon Atom vs Photon Atone might look like, to be discussed as a community over the coming weeks.

- Urgencies in constitution for minimal working draft to move forward such as,
  - How exactly to reform governance
  - Remove NWV or remove delegations altogether
  - Remove validator commission, include fixed rate
  - Validator distribution
  - Validators have machines onsite, i.e no white labels, no AWS
  - Validators should declare conflicts of interest
  - Should not roll out fixes that validators don't understand
  - If anything to be added to constitution, should be unchallenged for a given term (3 months?)
  - Potentially funding multiple teams of leading developers to compete to build ICS
