  - The audit itself will be posted publicly after addressing any issues that were highlighted from the [audit.](https://github.com/allinbits/govgen-governance-dapp)
  - Additionally, we’ll be launching an indexer with a modular query system to lower the unnecessary complexity with launching your own iteration of the GovGen dApp.
