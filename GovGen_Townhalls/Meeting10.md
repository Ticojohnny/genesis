**Brief Summary of Discussion**

Distribution of the first proposal has been finalized, it was presented and all attendees seemed to be in agreement or satisfied with the changes made, check the specifics in the notes here:

- Engineering updates:
  - Updates on $ATONE distribution: given last Townhall discussions, we
    investigated on higher multipliers for the No voters, and it appears that the
    x9 multiplier is the best fit for our case because:
    - No Voters get more than 60% of the supply
    - Yes voters get 1/3 of their initial part of the supply
    - Here is the general bar chart that shows the votes distribution with No
    multipliers from x4 to x10:

    - Here is a more detailled pie chart of the $ATONE distribution for the x9
    multiplier:

    - All the charts are visibles [here](https://atomone-hub.github.io/govbox/).

  - 'How to Submit Transactions Securely' guide has been merged and is available
    [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-proposals/blob/main/submit-tx-securely.md)


- MVP of the governance dApp has been completed and mainnet deployment is being scheduled.

- We intend to make significant progress on the constitution this month, beginning with remote meetings to determine participation. We aim to distribute a brief application form for interested individuals to submit later this week.

- Some attendees show interest in participating in the constitution calls and many verbalize agreement that they should be filtered down into smaller calls.

- Attendees express enthusiam about how transparent and effective the Townhall calls are in conjunction with the GitHub repository to stay aligned with community. 

- A couple UI suggestions were made to filter everything into folders that Trevor of the governance dApp picked up on to potentially implement into their dApp

- Some questions are covered on what the goal of AtomOne is, a minimial permissionless ICS hub

- Converation ensues about a suggestion to slash or penalize those who aren't voting in AtomOne
  - Some points are made about how incentive works better than punishment, someone suggests that your vote should weigh more than longer you are staked
  - Consider the possibility of delegating to non-validators

- A long conversation follows when an attendee proposes a multi-token approach to divide voting power from economic security however,
  - Many quickly point out there could be some issues with this sort of structure
  - Another attendee references some studies that were ran to disprove this system

- Another attendee points to a different model where different proposals have differing weights
