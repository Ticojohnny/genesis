    - https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-genesis/pull/1
    - 365 days voting period for text, 14 days for parameter change and 28 days for software upgrade
  - Potential discussions:
    - [refund text proposal deposit before the end of the voting period](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen/issues/8)
    - [consider disallowing validator vote on text proposal only](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen/issues/15)
